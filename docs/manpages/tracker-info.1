.TH tracker-info 1 "Oct 2008" GNU "User Commands"

.SH NAME
tracker-info \- Retrieve all information available for a certain file.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtracker-info\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...] \fIFILE\fR...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tracker-info
asks for all the known metadata available for the given \fIFILE\fR.

Multiple \fIFILE\fR arguments can be provided to retrieve information
about multiple files.

The \fIFILE\fR argument can be either a local path or a URI. It also
does not have to be an absolute path.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-?, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-full\-namespaces
By default, all keys and values reported about any given \fIFILE\fR
are returned in shortened form, for example, \fInie:title\fR is shown
instead of
\fIhttp://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie#title\fR.
This makes things much easier to see generally and the output is less
cluttered. This option reverses that so FULL namespaces are shown
instead.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-plain\-text\-content
If the resource being displayed has nie:PlainTextContent (i.e.
information about the content of the resource, which could be the
contents of a file on the disk), then this option displays that in the
output.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-turtle
Output results as Turtle RDF. If \-f is enabled, full URIs are shown
for subjects, predicates and objects; otherwise, shortened URIs are
used, and all the prefixes Tracker knows about are printed at the top
of the output.
